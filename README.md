## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yyemaen321/Secure-Next-Express-Template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Secure-Next-Express-Template
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file**:

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

5. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start building your application. The template provides a solid foundation with authentication and API integration already in place. You can customize components, routes, and styles according to your needs.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **GET /api/user**: Get user information (requires authentication).
- **PUT /api/user**: Update user information (requires authentication).

You can test these endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Authentication

The application uses JWT for authentication. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Login**: Send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with user credentials. On success, you receive a JWT.
2. **Access Protected Routes**: Include the JWT in the `Authorization` header for any protected routes.
3. **Logout**: Clear the JWT from your client-side storage.

### Example Login Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourpassword"}'
```

### Example Protected Route Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/user \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Styling

The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Tailwind provides utility classes that allow you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. You can modify styles in the `styles` directory.

### Customizing Tailwind

To customize Tailwind, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can add new colors, spacing, and more.
